In this assignment, I implemented inheritance using the extends keyword by creating Student and Teacher classes that inherit from the Person class, clearly demonstrating an IS-A relationship (a Student is a Person, and a Teacher is a Person). I also applied constructors and the super keyword to properly initialize inherited attributes in multilevel relationships. This design ensures code reusability and consistency while maintaining a clear parent–child class structure. The displayInfo() method in Person is reused by both child classes, showing how inheritance simplifies implementation.

I also demonstrated a HAS-A relationship and aggregation through the Teacher class, which contains an array of Course objects. This shows that a Teacher has Courses, but Courses can exist independently, which matches the concept of aggregation. I designed a simple real-world Java application representing a school system and tested it in the Main class by creating objects and displaying their data. Through this, I successfully applied inheritance, aggregation, constructors, and object interaction in a clean, organized, and realistic Java program that meets all the stated objectives of the assignment.
