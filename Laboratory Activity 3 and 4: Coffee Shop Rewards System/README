In this assignment, I designed a real-world coffee shop loyalty system to apply core object-oriented principles in Java. 
I implemented both default and parameterized constructors in the Customer class to show how objects can be created with 
or without initial data. I correctly used the this keyword to refer to instance variables inside constructors and methods, 
ensuring that object attributes are properly assigned and updated. This allows each customer object to maintain its 
own state while sharing the same class behavior.

I also demonstrated the use of static variables and static methods through totalCustomers and displayTotalCustomers(), 
which track and display the total number of registered customers across all objects. The program uses arrays, loops, 
conditionals, and method calls to manage customer records, add loyalty points, and handle free drink rewards. Overall, 
this assignment shows how constructors, the this keyword, static members, and object interaction can be applied in 
a practical, real-world Java application using proper object-oriented design.
