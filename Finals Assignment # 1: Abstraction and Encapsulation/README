In this assignment, I explained the difference between abstraction and encapsulation by showing that abstraction hides 
how things work so we can focus on what an object does, while encapsulation hides and protects an object’s internal 
data using controlled access. I described how both concepts support each other: abstraction provides a simple interface, 
and encapsulation protects the data behind it. I also discussed that getters and setters can create a false sense of 
security if they are poorly designed, and I emphasized the importance of validation, limited access, and immutability 
to make encapsulation truly effective.

Lastly, I showed how interfaces support abstraction but can cause design problems when classes are forced to implement 
irrelevant methods. I used the Vehicle example where a truck is required to implement a fly() method, which does not 
make sense. As a workaround, I applied interface segregation by splitting the interface into smaller ones so each 
class only implements behaviors it actually needs. This demonstrates how proper interface design leads to cleaner, 
more logical, and more maintainable code.
