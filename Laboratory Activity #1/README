In this assignment, I created a basic Java library management system that solves a real-world problem: tracking books and 
their availability. I used Java arrays (bookTitles and bookStatus) to store and manage book data, and I controlled the 
program flow using loops and conditional statements through a menu-driven interface. The do-while loop keeps the program 
running until the user exits, while if-else and switch statements handle different user actions such as adding books, 
updating status, and generating reports.

I also organized the program using reusable methods such as addBook(), updateBookStatus(), displayBooks(), 
generateReport(), and getIntInput() to keep the code clean and modular. This structure improves readability, reduces repetition, 
and makes the program easier to maintain. Overall, my implementation demonstrates how arrays, loops, conditionals, 
and method organization can work together to build a simple but functional real-world Java application.
