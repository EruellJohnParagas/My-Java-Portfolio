In our midterm lab examination, we created a Smart Home System to demonstrate the basic concepts of 
object-oriented programming in Java. We designed the Device class as the base class containing 
common properties and behaviors, and we implemented constructors, method overloading, 
the this keyword, and a static variable and method to track and display the total number 
of devices created. We also applied proper naming conventions and organized the code into clear, 
readable classes to keep the program modular and maintainable.

Other than that We also extended the Device class into LightBulb and Thermostat subclasses 
to show inheritance, method overriding, and method overloading. The Thermostat class demonstrates 
overloaded setTemperature() methods, while LightBulb overrides displayInfo() to add more specific 
details. We used a SmartHomeController class to manage multiple devices using an array, showing 
how objects can be controlled as a group. Overall, we successfully applied OOP principles to build 
a functional, structured, and real-world Java application that meets all the objectives of 
the midterm lab examination.
