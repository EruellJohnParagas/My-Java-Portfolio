In this assignment, I designed a smart-device control system to demonstrate polymorphism in Java. I implemented method 
overriding by defining the abstract method showStatus() in the Device parent class and providing different implementations 
in each subclass (AirConditioner, LampShade, Television, and Microwave). Each device displays its own unique status, proving 
that the same method behaves differently depending on the object type. I also used polymorphic references by storing all 
child objects inside an ArrayList<Device>, where the parent type (Device) points to different child objects.

I demonstrated runtime polymorphism and dynamic binding when calling turnOn() and showStatus() through the parent reference. 
Even though the list stores objects as Device, Java automatically calls the correct overridden showStatus() method based on 
the actual object type at runtime. I further applied this concept through the static methods setPowerForAll() and 
countPoweredOn(), which operate on a collection of mixed device objects using only the parent type. Overall, 
this program clearly shows how polymorphism, method overriding, dynamic binding, and parent-type collections 
work together in a real-world style Java application.
